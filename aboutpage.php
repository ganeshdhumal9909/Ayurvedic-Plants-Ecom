Owing to fast paced world that are living in, we are getting far from the nature. While the lifestyle that we live can have adverse effect on us, it is important to know that by introducing small changes in our daily life can go a long way in keeping us healthy and
energetic. Therefore, the importance of Ayurveda holds true in today’s life as it is based on the principal of bringing us close to nature and relying on its natural powers to cure us and  
keep us healthy without any side effects.<br>
 <br>
Thanks to the use of natural ingredients and medicinal herbs, Ayurvedic medicines and products today have become a symbol of safety in contrast to synthetic drugs that are considered 
unsafe and hazardous for overall health. <br>
 <br>
One way of understanding the basic fundamentals of Ayurveda is to spend more time with nature 
and observe the plants and herbs. Each plant or herb has a specific quality and can be used 
to treat multitude of ailments and diseases. Medicinal plants like aloe, turmeric, tulsi, pepper,
elachi and ginger are commonly used in a number of Ayurvedic home remedies and are
considered to be the best aid among fighting ailments related to throat and skin. As a rich 
source of nutrients, anti-bacterial and antioxidant properties, ayurvedic herbs are non-toxic 
in nature and so the products or remedies made using them are often recommended for their 
high therapeutic value. <br>
 <br>
Treatment with herbal medicinal plants also hold a strong ground because these plants are 
considered to be safe and have no side effects. Since they are in sync with nature, they hold 
greater advantage over chemically treated products and synthetic medicines. As opposed to
other drugs and medicines, Ayurvedic herbs are known to treat the disease from the root and 
thus aid in keeping you healthy and fit in the long run. <br>
 <br>
Apart from medicinal use, these herbs can also be used for purposes like pest control, natural 
dyes, and formulation of food items, teas and perfumes among others. If we look at 
various researches from across the world, a sudden spurt in cases of people turning to 
natural herbs for treatments and usage in everyday life has gone up significantly. Going 
back to the basics, people have realized the threat chemically treated products pose to their life 
and are rightly so adopting healthier ways of life by including Ayurveda and its 
principals as the mainstay of their life. <br>
